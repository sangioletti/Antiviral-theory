v1 integrals are calculated using quad function.

v2 integrals are computed by sampling at finite number of points then using numerical quadrature. Everything related to binding terms works in v2

v3 is like v2 but adds the part dependent on repulsion

v4 (many equations changed because the previous theory did not really make sense, you were dividing by the number of bonds including fractional ones to calculate the average bond energy but this does not make too  much sense. Needs to be divided by the number of receptors instead...look at your notes).

v6 is the working implementation with the new formulas.

v7 is like v6 but attempt at vectorising...

v8 solves the equation for pL using bisection method instead of self-consistent equations. Very stable and much better (latter sometime did not converge!)
